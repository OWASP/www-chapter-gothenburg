## About OWASP Gothenburg

The vision for OWASP Gothenburg is to increase interest in and spread knowledge of how to architect and build secure software systems. It is to provide a balanced mix of the latest word in academic security research (cutting edge), established security practices and design principles for direct application (breadth and maturity). The most important elements in the construction of secure applications are design- and development methodologies, OWASP Gothenburg will hence strive to increase the security-mindedness of application developers.

OWASP Gothenburg brings together a great community of developers, project leaders and security professionals by offering interesting presentations and demonstrations on a wide range of security-related topics. Community hacks, social get-togethers and local as well as international speakers make us a platform and forum for anyone interested to meet like-minded people, exchange ideas and discuss the latest developments and news in security.

Everyone is free to participate in, and attend any of our meetings!

If you are interested in helping out or if you have a suggestion on e.g. an exciting and interesting speaker or topic, please get in touch with us!
Our primary communication channel is the owasp-gothenburg mailinglist, all meetings, events and other news are announced on the mailing list.
